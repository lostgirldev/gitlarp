Soleng's Analysis:

### Project Overview: Stealth SDK

The **Stealth SDK** is a software development kit designed for building chatbot applications. It supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript and Luau (used in Roblox), and integrates with various AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. The project is hosted on GitHub and has a relatively small community and activity level.

### Key Statistics

1. **Stars**: 17
   - This indicates a modest level of interest from the GitHub community. A higher star count typically suggests that the project is more popular or widely used.

2. **Forks**: 2
   - The project has been forked twice, which means that other developers have created their own versions of the project. This can be a sign of interest, but the low number suggests limited engagement.

3. **Contributors**: 1
   - There is only one contributor to the project, which may indicate that it is still in the early stages of development or that it is primarily a personal project.

4. **Languages Used**: 
   - The project is primarily written in JavaScript (52%) and Luau (47.37%), with minimal use of Shell and Dockerfile. This suggests that it is primarily aimed at web and game development environments.

5. **Total Lines of Code**: 156,988
   - A large codebase can indicate a complex project, but it can also be overwhelming for new contributors or users.
