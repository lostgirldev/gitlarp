#### Supported Blockchains
- **Solana**: A well-known blockchain platform.
- **EVM (Coming soon)**: Indicates future expansion to support Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchains.

#### Security Features
The project emphasizes security through the use of TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technology, which protects sensitive operations and user data. This is particularly important in the context of managing digital assets like NFTs.

#### Social Media Presence
- **Owner Twitter**: Not found

#### Conclusion
The **xNomad-AI/core** project appears to be a promising initiative in the AI-NFT space, with a focus on security and functionality. While it is still in its early stages, the active development, lack of open issues, and good community health are positive indicators of its potential. 

However, the low star count and limited number of contributors suggest that it may not yet have widespread recognition or support. If you are interested in the intersection of AI and NFTs, this project could be worth exploring further, especially given its innovative features and security measures. 

Overall, while it may not be a heavyweight project yet, it has the potential to grow and become more significant in the future.
