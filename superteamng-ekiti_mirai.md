- **No Social Media Presence**: The lack of a Twitter account for the owner could indicate limited engagement with the community.
- **Potential**: While the project may have potential, especially in the AI trading space, its current state suggests it may not be worth investing time into until it shows more activity and clearer documentation.

In summary, the **mirai** project appears to be in its infancy and may not be a robust option for exploration at this time. It would be advisable to monitor its progress over the coming months to see if it gains more activity and community engagement.
